## How to Install
1. Download the .tpp file in release page.
2. Make sure that you have the YTMDesktop app installed or else this plugin will not work.
3. Open TouchPortal and click import Plugins then pick the file that you downloaded it should tell you Plugin has successfully installed.
4. Next, fully close TouchPortal, and on Windows Start Panel, type run or press `Windows+R` and enter `%appdata%\TouchPortal\plugins\TouchPortalYTMusic`<br>
  On mac it should be in Documents folder > TouchPortal > plugins > TouchPortalYTMusic.
5. Open the **Login.json** with any text editor you have.
6. Go to the YTMDesktop app and click Settings > Integrations and enable Remote control and you can have either Protect remote control with password enable or disable.
    If it is disabled you can skip step 7.
7. If Protect remote control with a password is enabled you should able to see something like "XXXXX" in the **Login.json** file that you have opened, replace XXXXX with yours, or else Action will NOT WORK.
8. Save the file that you've edited it should look something like this `{"Password": "MWA5Q"}`<br>
  **AND DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE OR ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK.**<br>
  Just save it with "XXXXX" replaced with your own code found in your YTMDesktop app under Settings/Integration.
9. Now you have everything set up, you should be able to reopen TouchPortal and you can click any button and should see a new Category that says "YouTube Music".<br>
  If you don't that means you did something wrong. If you did right you should be good to go.
